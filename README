This is a little code for a startup delay for audio amplifiers.

With a soft-switch, one relay will turn on and provide power to the amplifier.
After a delay of 5 seconds, another (or more) relay(s) will turn on and connect the loudspeaker(s) to the amp.

This avoids DC current to the speakers while the capacitors are getting charged.

The schematic contains 2 relays, one for the initial power switch, and one for a speaker.
To add more speaker relays, just copy the Relay, MOSFET and Diode and connect them to the gate of the first MOSFET.
